# Lack of knowledge on JavaScript

Similarly to Assignment 1, I was very ambitious with my ideas, only to realize I did not have enough JavaScript knowledge to execute them. It was the process of a lot of trials and errors, and a lot of frustration, but at the same time, these experiences gave me so much more insight on JavaScript

# Mental health struggles

Personally, the biggest struggle for me was with my mental health. I suffer from ADHD, and the pressure of getting used to a new country and the amount of schoolwork has taken a toll on me. It is very difficult for me to find motivation to push through and even waking up everyday was a struggle. I ended up skipping classes and missing out on materials taught in class, and had to self study everything. However, I am proud of myself for being able to complete this assignment, even though, I find my net art not meeting my expectations and my blog being a lot less detailed than my first one. It actually hurts me how short and vague this blog is, but I could not manage to find anything else to talk about. The last few weeks were very blurry for me. Still, the semester is coming to an end, and I have got so far already, so I am proud regardless. I will still try my best to do better.

# My art disappearing from the canvas

It was 100% my fault for making this mistake, and it took me so long to figure it out as well. I would use mouse click to generate random patterns on my canvas, however, they appeared for one split second then got wiped out. Turns out I put background in my draw function, so my canvas would keep resetting and deleting my patterns.
